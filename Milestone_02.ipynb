    "In this final step, your goal is to synthesize your entire modeling process and assess how your earlier decisions influenced the outcome. Please address the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Model Selection:\n",
    "- Clearly state which model you selected as your final model and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What metrics or observations led you to this decision?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Were there trade-offs (e.g., interpretability vs. performance) that influenced your choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Revisiting an Early Decision\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify one specific preprocessing or feature engineering decision from Milestone 1 (e.g., how you handled missing values, how you scaled or encoded a variable, or whether you created interaction or polynomial terms).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain the rationale for that decision at the time: What were you hoping it would achieve?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now that you've seen the full modeling pipeline and final results, reflect on whether this step helped or hindered performance. Did you keep it, modify it, or remove it?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Justify your final decision with evidence—such as validation scores, visualizations, or model diagnostics.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Lessons Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "- What insights did you gain about your dataset or your modeling process through this end-to-end workflow?\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you had more time or data, what would you explore next?"
